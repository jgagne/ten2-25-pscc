### My Name Is… Broadsheet

In this project, designers express and represent their personal identity through a broadsheet newspaper format (`380mm` x `578mm`), choosing a section from a traditional broadsheet such as Finances, Food, Arts, or Travel.

The goal is to create a personal identity piece using typography to reflect who you are, what you value, and what you love. This builds on the emotional connection with hand-drawn type explored in the previous week. The project will also delve into the history and evolution of printing, drawing influences from hot metal typesetting and traditional broadsheet design, while focusing on typography’s emotional resonance and visual storytelling.

Consider integrating original artwork — such as photographs or illustrations — alongside your written content. All text should be original or carefully sourced from meaningful references. This project should tell a story about you through your selected section, content, and typography. Begin with black and white as your foundation, and later introduce color as an enhancement in an alternative version.

Begin by doing some research. Find examples broadsheets that match your personality. Any research is better than no research. Sketch your layouts on paper first. Feel free to use colored paper to represent content types.

### Full Justification

| Setting                      | Minimum | Desired                     | Maximum | Notes                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Word Spacing**             | 80%     | 100%                        | 120%    | Adjusts word spacing to ensure a visually consistent flow.                                                          |
| **Letter Spacing**           | 90%     | 100%                        | 110%    | Fine-tunes the spacing between letters to prevent stretching or squishing.                                          |
| **Glyph Scaling**            | 98%     | 100%                        | 102%    | Slight adjustments to character width help prevent awkward gaps or overcrowding in justified text.                  |
| **Composer**                 | -       | Adobe Paragraph Composer    | -       | The Paragraph Composer generally provides more balanced and natural spacing compared to the Single-line Composer.   |
| **Left/Right Justification** | -       | Align Text to Justify       | -       | Ensures that the text aligns evenly to both the left and right margins.                                             |
| **Hyphenation**              | -       | Enabled (with minor tweaks) | -       | Allow hyphenation, but adjust to ensure it's not too aggressive (e.g., set **Words with 7 or fewer letters** to 0). |
| **Hyphenation Zone**         | -       | 3–5 mm                    | -       | Adjusts the space allowed before a word can be hyphenated.                                                          |
| **No Break**                 | -       | Applied selectively         | -       | Common for certain terms or proper nouns (e.g., “New York” or “CEO”).                                       |
| **Justification Style**      | -       | Adobe Paragraph Composer    | -       | Ensures balanced spacing and avoids excessive word spacing or unsightly rivers of white space.                      |

### Font Licensing

> **Does my client need their own font license to use the artwork I created using the fonts?**
>
> No, not if you are creating graphics or documents that have rasterized or properly embedded font data, such as a PDF, JPEG, or PNG.
>
> However, if your client needs to have the font installed to edit your design, they will need their own license, either through a Creative Cloud subscription or a desktop license purchase.

### Springtime

Design a poster or poster series (B1: `707 mm` x `1000 mm`) on the theme of spring or springtime.

What does springtime mean to you? Does it represent a holiday, such as Easter or Labor Day (Fête du Travail, Fiesta del Trabajo, etc.), or something else?

Maybe something more positive, like the change in weather, flowers in bloom, spring showers (rain), music festivals, etc.?

- Choose [fonts via Google](https://fonts.google.com).
- Use original content and artwork.
- Consider how your typography and layout will flow and adapt to different sizes such as an A4 (`210 mm` x `297 mm`)  or your phone’s viewport (unknown).
- Work in black and white to start, then add springtime color(s) as an enhancement.

### Tangential

> The average hourly pay for a **junior graphic designer** in Prague is **350.00 Kč** based on data for early-career professionals (1-4 years of experience)<sup>[1]</sup>. However, this figure represents **total compensation** (including tips, bonuses, and overtime), not strictly base hourly pay. The base hourly rate for graphic designers in the Czech Republic is listed as **230.00 Kč**<sup>[1]</sup>, though this appears to be a general average rather than specifically tailored to junior roles or agency positions.
>
> For context, junior roles at agencies often align with entry-level pay scales, which may fall closer to the lower end of the compensation spectrum. The search results do not provide explicit hourly rates for junior designers at agencies, but the total compensation figure of **350.00 Kč** for early-career professionals offers the most relevant benchmark<sup>[1]</sup>.
>
> **Key factors influencing pay**:
> - **Experience**: Junior roles typically correspond to the 1–4 year range<sup>[1]</sup>.
> - **Employer type**: Agencies may offer competitive rates compared to in-house roles<sup>[1]</sup>.
> - **Additional compensation**: Bonuses or overtime can elevate total earnings beyond base pay<sup>[1]</sup>.
>
> For precise agency-specific rates, direct negotiation or localized job postings would provide more tailored insights.
